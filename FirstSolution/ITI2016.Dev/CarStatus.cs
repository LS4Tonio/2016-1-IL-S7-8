    A Car can be in multiple states:
    - The engine is running or not.
    - There may be a speed engaged (typically 5 speeds)
    - The clutch pedal can be pressed or not.
    - The gas pedal can be pressed or not.
    - The brake pedal can be pressed or not.
    - The hand brake can be set or not.

    How do you (efficiently) encode this state?
